<div ng-bind-html="trustedHtml" class="ng-binding"><p>You're given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.</p>
<p>If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.</p>
<p>If there are multiple solutions, return any one. </p>
<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>
<pre><code>Input : [1 2 3 1 1]
Output : 1 
1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times. 
</code></pre></div>
